When we received our new dining chairs, we were very disappointed. Again, these were very uncomfortable chairs made of hard plastic. Again, very different from the chairs online being displayed as amenities for this residence hall. I and all of my roommates, as well as other people in Cuic have discussed our immense displeasure and anger over the new furniture, especially the dining chairs. I believe it is unfair to be shown that we would be getting comfortable furniture online, only to reveal that we would be living with very uncomfortable furniture, especially given the rent rates that we pay. I pay almost the same rent as my friends in full apartments, and those include kitchens, and real, livable furniture.

October,296,R_2f8WjfQz1iP1N94,Unsatisfied,"Unsatisfied is an understatement. I have lived on campus for almost two years and can confidently say SDSU does not care if their students receive adequate housing. Students are forced to face the consequences of SDSU's choice to overadmit and are left crammed into a space that was never meant¬†for the amount of people. So here I am paying nearly the same amount (give or take 100$) as someone living off campus, yet I am forced to live and pay for a room that has far worse living conditions. The financial¬†aid office is more helpful in resolving any issues I might have (even after waiting 3 hrs on zoom) than the housing office. In conclusion, if I could find a way to attend SDSU and not live on campus, it would have already been done by now.
